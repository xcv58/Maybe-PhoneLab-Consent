<h2>Maybe Consent Agreement</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    One of the reasons programming mobile systems is so hard is the uncertainty created by the wide variety of environments a typical app encounters at runtime. In many cases only post-deployment user testing can determine the right algorithm to use, the rate at which something should happen, or when an app should attempt to conserve energy. Programmers should not be forced to make these choices at development time. But todayâ€™s programming languages leave no way for programmers to express and structure their uncertainty about runtime conditions, forcing them to adopt ineffective, fragile, and untested ad-hoc approaches to runtime adaptation. We introduce a new approach based on structured uncertainty through a new language construct: the maybe statement.
